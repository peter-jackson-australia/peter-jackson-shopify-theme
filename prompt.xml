    <context>I have this Shopify Liquid theme code for an interactive mega menu sidebar drawer component that uses Shopify Liquid, Alpine.JS, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Everything is working correctly so far</context>
    <problem>When hovering over a link in menu level 2, a third sidebar drawer opens up with a preview of products contained in that particular collection. I would like you to extend the functionality so that this drawer stays open for 400ms before it closes AND if the user hovers over it, it stays open until the user stops hovering over it.</problem>
    <example>User A opens the sidebar mega menu drawer by clikcing the "menu" button. The first level of the mega menu opens up. The user sees a collection they are interested in, "Suits", that has second level nested menu links, the user clicks "Suits". The second level menu drawer opens up and there are additional collections. The user see's a collection that DOES NOT have further nested menu links and is just a link to that collection page, they hover over this link and a preview of the collection opens, they hover over to a product they are interested in and the preview stays open, they decide to move the mouse away and the preview closes</example>

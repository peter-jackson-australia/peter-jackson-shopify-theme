        <summary>This file is the base CSS file for the entire website, it includes a modern CSS reset, and some base stylings. I want you to remove all properties that are not 100% percent needed. I would consider anything layout related, like flex settings, margins etc to be needed. The file is 565 lines long, I would ideally like to get it down to 200-300</summary>
        <detailed-description>Using best practice CSS standards, revise this stylesheet to be as minimal, functional and useful as possible for the base CSS styles defined within it. Reduce the line count down to 200-300. Ensure no repitition and group selectors where possible. Also include comments for the different sections and future sections - This is just the global CSS file which will contain styles that are reused across the site.</detailed-description>

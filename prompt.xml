		<problem>I would like to create a modal that is triggered by clicking a button with the text "What's my size?". The button can be placed in a div with the element with class product-details__sku on the left and the newly created button on the right, with the same font.</problem>
		<goal priority="high">The modal should be triggered by the "What's my size" button and place a dark overlay over the whole screen, also, lock the scrolling on the body. There should be a close icon which can use the snippet "icon-close.liquid", clicking this icon or anywhere in the overlay will close the modal. Inside of the modal, I want you to simply render the "size-guide.liquid" snippet. </goal>

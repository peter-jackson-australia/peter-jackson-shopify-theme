		<problem>I have a Shopify Liquid theme for my online store. The products page (sections/main-product.liquid) has a badly styled section for the product images which I want to fix</problem>
		<goal priority="high">Turn the product images into a VERTICAL Splide slider that has a progress bar on the LEFT HAND side. The slider will be 100% of the viewport height on desktop and 50% of the viewport width. On mobile, the product image slider should be exactly the same as the Splide slider in snippets/product-card.liquid (The arrows sitting on top of the image and the progress bar on the bottom of the image). You are to rewrite all code inside of sections/main-product.liquid that is related to this image gallery slider to achieve my goal. The solution must be as simple and accurate as possible, with no conflicts with the other files</goal>

                <description>This is a code example of how to instantiate a vertical Splide slider that responds to mouse movements for scrolling. You'll need to set waitForTransition to true or provide the wheelSleep duration.</description>
                <code>
                    var splide = new Splide( '.splide', {
                    direction: 'ttb',
                    height   : '10rem',

	<examples purpose="To illustrate examples of what succesfully completing the goal will look like">
		<example>"User A" navigates to our website homepage from a Google search, he finds the product he is interested in buying and clicks on it and is taken to the product page. On the left hand side of the products page is container that takes up 50 percent of User A's laptop screen and it contains the first image of the product. The user hovers over this image and scrolls down and the next image loads and the progress bar on the left hand side of the container moves the progress indicator down towards the bottom of the container. The user scrolls all the way to the end of the container and the final image shows and the progress bar is at the bottom of the container.</example>
    	<example>"User B" navigates to our website homepage from a Google search on his mobile phone. He finds a product he is interested in buying and taps on it and is taken to the product page. Just underneath the site header is a full width image slider with a previous arrow on the left and a next arrow on the right, both arrows sit on top of the product images directly in the middle vertically. The user swipes to the left and the second image is shown and the progress bar on the bottom of the container moves the progress indicator to the right. The user scrolls all the way to end and the progress indicator is all the way at the end</example>

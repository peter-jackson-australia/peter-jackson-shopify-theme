Its natural lustre, supple hand feel and clarity of colour speak to something deeper: the finishing process perfected in Biella, Italy, where pristine alpine water is used to wash and treat the wool, enhancing both its feel and tonal richness.<br><br>Woven in Italy from 100% Merino wool, the cloth that delivers breathability, softness and structure without weight. Cut with soft tailoring for a more relaxed silhouette, these suits are designed to shift easily between work, event and everything after. Versatile, refined and unmistakably Peter Jackson.",

Where traditional suiting often leans sleek and flat, corduroy adds visual intrigue and tactile richness. A peak-lapel corduroy blazer or a cuffed trouser with side tabs speaks not just to detail, but to modern sophistication.Its adaptability is another draw. Modern corduroy is far lighter and softer than past versions, making it seasonally agile. It holds warmth through the cooler months without feeling bulky — ideal for layering or as a standalone statement. In rich greens, sand tones, and deep navy, corduroy invites tonal dressing with nuance and dimension.",

Paired with a cream turtleneck, the look gains softness and balance — a nod to classic elegance made current. Add sand loafers, and the palette becomes grounded and wearable, bridging the divide between formal and relaxed.This is how corduroy functions best in today’s wardrobe: not as a costume piece, but as a stylish counterpoint to denim, flannel, or suiting wool. It’s a material that plays with contrasts — polished yet tactile, tailored yet easy.",

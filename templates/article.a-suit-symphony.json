Its natural lustre, supple hand feel and clarity of colour speak to something deeper: the finishing process perfected in Biella, Italy, where pristine alpine water is used to wash and treat the wool, enhancing both its feel and tonal richness.<br><br>Woven in Italy from 100% Merino wool, the cloth that delivers breathability, softness and structure without weight. Cut with soft tailoring for a more relaxed silhouette, these suits are designed to shift easily between work, event and everything after. Versatile, refined and unmistakably Peter Jackson.",

Where traditional suiting often leans sleek and flat, corduroy adds visual intrigue and tactile richness. A peak-lapel corduroy blazer or a cuffed trouser with side tabs speaks not just to detail, but to modern sophistication.Its adaptability is another draw. Modern corduroy is far lighter and softer than past versions, making it seasonally agile. It holds warmth through the cooler months without feeling bulky — ideal for layering or as a standalone statement. In rich greens, sand tones, and deep navy, corduroy invites tonal dressing with nuance and dimension.",

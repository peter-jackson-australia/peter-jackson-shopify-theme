Its natural lustre, supple hand feel and clarity of colour speak to something deeper: the finishing process perfected in Biella, Italy, where pristine alpine water is used to wash and treat the wool, enhancing both its feel and tonal richness.<br><br>Woven in Italy from 100% Merino wool, the cloth that delivers breathability, softness and structure without weight. Cut with soft tailoring for a more relaxed silhouette, these suits are designed to shift easily between work, event and everything after. Versatile, refined and unmistakably Peter Jackson.",

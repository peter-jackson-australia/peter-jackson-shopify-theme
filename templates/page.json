We use Merino wool because its resilient natural stretch prevents it from losing its shape. When the fabric is stretched, the fibres natural crimp acts like a spring returning it to its original form. Its durability also stems from it being comprised of a special protein called Keratin. Keratin acts as a barrier, protecting you (and the sheep!) from environmental elements</p>",

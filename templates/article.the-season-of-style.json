Things like polos, overshirts, and field jackets work perfectly to get you through the brisk mornings as well as the warm afternoons. As the temperature fluctuates, so does your outfit, with layers being easy to remove (or re-add) as needed.Start with lighter base layers and build outward from there, with a slightly heavier layer for warmth covered by a larger outer layer to protect you from the elements as required. Limiting yourself to three items will keep you from feeling weighed down and looking convoluted.On days that you're headed into the office, a crisp white dress shirt pairs perfectly with a dark, earth tone tie and our lightweight field jacket for a professional yet relaxed look.",

Avoid wearing too many light and bright colours at this time of year (unless you want to look like an extra in Miami Vice) Ideally, your outfit should be made up predominantly of those quieter, more subtle hues, with one or two pieces providing contrast either by being lighter or darker than the rest, or by adding a pop of colour. This could mean wearing an olive green t-shirt under a taupe suit, or a light shirt under a darker ensemble. Have fun and play around with it, but avoid the risk of overdoing it.</p><p>Building a transeasonal wardrobe allows you to easily adapt to any situation and look good in any setting. You can leave the house confident that you’re prepared for anything. And the best part? We’ve got everything that you need to get started. All you need to do is decide which items will make your life (and mornings) a whole lot easier.</p>",

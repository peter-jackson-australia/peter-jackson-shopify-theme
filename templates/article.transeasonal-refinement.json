One day, you're struggling to leave the bed, and the next, you're dreaming of the beach and a six-pack of your favourite beer. How are you supposed to dress for this kind of weather? Thankfully, it doesn't have to be complicated. All you need are a few key layer-friendly pieces that bridge the gap between winter warmth and spring breeziness.",

As the temperature fluctuates, so does your outfit, with layers being easy to remove (or re-add) as needed.<br><br>Start with lighter base layers and build outward from there, with a slightly heavier layer for warmth covered by a larger outer layer to protect you from the elements as required. Limiting yourself to three items will keep you from feeling weighed down and looking convoluted.",

This email will only be an acknowledgment and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A contract between us for the purchase of the goods will not be formed until we have conducted any verification (see 5.C.1 below) that may be necessary for your order, your payment has been approved by us, and we have debited your credit or debit card.</p><p>5.B.1. Pricing and Availability</p><p>Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions, and prices that appear on this Website are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of any goods which you have ordered we will inform you of this as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it.

Payment</p><p>The conditions of use relating to any discount code will be specified at the time of issue.</p><p>5.E.1. Gift Cards</p><p>Gift cards may be physical cards sent in the mail or digital cards that are sent in an email. Gift cards are issued in Australian dollars and are redeemable in Australian stores and on the Australian website. They are not redeemable for cash. No change will be given for a purchase made with a gift card. Physical cards are intended to be redeemed in a physical store and digital cards are intended to be redeemed online. In the event a card is not being used for its intended purpose, you are required to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:info@peterjacksons.com\">info@peterjacksons.com</a> to activate it for use. The gift card expires twelve months from the date of issue (or date of purchase for E-Gift Cards). Gift cards are partially redeemable and it is up to the cardholder to use the full value within the validity period. Any unused balance will not be refunded or credited when the card expires. When the cost of a purchase exceeds the available card balance, the cardholder will be required to make up the difference with an alternate form of payment. Gift Cards should be treated like cash.

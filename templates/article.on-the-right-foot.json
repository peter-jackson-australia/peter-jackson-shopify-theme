It's not a matter of which is better but more so which one can serve your desired purpose more. Single monk straps boast a sleek, streamlined design, making them perfect for business, formal, and smart casual occasions.  For a timeless formal work look, opt for a pair of classic black single monk strap shoes teamed with a charcoal pinstripe suit and white shirt, or a three-piece charcoal suit.Double monk straps are great for weddings, parties, and casual settings. For a smart weekend look, you can't go wrong with deep chestnut brown double monks paired with jeans and a crewneck.If your wardrobe consists of many charcoal and grey suits, consider adding a pair of black monk straps.",
